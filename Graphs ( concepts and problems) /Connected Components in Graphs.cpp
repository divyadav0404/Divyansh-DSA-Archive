Apparently, it's a graph, which is in 4 pieces, the last one being a single node. In this case, we can say, the graph has been broken down into 4 different connected components. So next time if you see two different parts of a graph and they are not connected, then do not say that it cannot be a single graph. In the above example, they can be 4 different graphs but according to the given question and the input, we can call them parts of a single graph.

Graph Traversal 
In the upcoming topics, we’ll be learning about a lot of algorithms. Now, assume a traversal algorithm. Any traversal algorithm will always use a visited array. 

For the same example, we will create an array of size 11 (n+1) starting with the zeroth index. Initialize this visited array to zero, indicating that all the nodes are unvisited. Then follow the following algorithm. If a node is not visited, then call the traversal algorithm.

Why can’t we just call traversal(1)?

We cannot just call traversal(node) because a graph can have multiple components and traversal algorithms are designed in such a way that they will traverse the entire connected portion of the graph. For example, traversal(1) will traverse only the connected nodes, i.e., nodes 2, 3, and 4, but not the connected components.


//baiscally any traversal algo must use a visited array..
